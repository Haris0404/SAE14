      <h2>My passion: Football </h2>
      <p>
        This web page is dedicated to football which is a passion for me. So, on this page you will understand the origin of my passion and how I live my passion today.

            My passion for football started at a very young age when I started playing football in a club at the age of 7. Indeed, my parents signed me up for football with the aim of practising a sporting activity without necessarily taking into account the sport I was going to play in itself. It was not my choice to play football either. So I started playing football at the age of 7. From day one, I really enjoyed the sport, because of the team spirit. At the age of 9, I started to participate in real matches against outside teams. I played as a left defender, a role that I liked very much because it offered the possibility of advancing into the opponent's camp during the attacking phases and therefore of not staying only in defence. From the age of 7 to 12 I played for Clermont-MÃ©tropole, a small club that did not have a professional team. This club was more for amateur players and did not offer training for the over 15s. I then decided to change club and to try my luck by doing the recruitment test at Clermont-Foot, a much bigger club whose professional team played at the time in league 2, now in league 1 but therefore very difficult to integrate. So I got a favourable answer and 2 weeks later I was part of the club. In this club I was very well integrated. I played a lot of games and even won a regional tournament. However, at the age of 15, when I entered the second year of high school, I had to make a choice, either to continue playing football or to study. Indeed, the two were incompatible because the club imposed training 4 days a week often in the late afternoon from 5pm which was too early for me, and took time I needed to devote to school. So, after a lot of thought, I made the choice to stop playing club football as I was not sure I was going to make a career out of it. So I made the choice not to take any risks by continuing my studies because it should normally guarantee me a diploma at the end.

            Today, even if I don't play football in a club anymore, football remains a sport that I like very much and that I practice in my free time with friends. Otherwise, my passion is expressed by following football matches, especially the big competitions like the Champions League or the European or world competitions like the EURO and the World Cup. I also like to play football virtually through video games like FIFA or PES.

            My favourite football club is Real Madrid. It is a football team located in the city of Madrid in Spain and is without doubt one of the most famous clubs in world football. It was founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club before King Alfonso XIII gave it the term "Real", which means royal, and gave it the crown on the club logo. In 2022, the club's achievements include 35 Spanish league titles, 14 Champions League victories and four Club World Cup titles. Today, it is considered one of the best clubs in the world.

        <p>I was lucky to be able to attend a Champions League match in February 2022, between Real Madrid and PSG. Unfortunately Real Madrid lost the match by a score of 1-0 but it was still an incredible experience to watch such an intense match.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, football is more than a hobby for me as it occupies most of my free time between practicing sports, playing video games and finally following the matches of my favourite teams.</p>
